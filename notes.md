Three intentions:
  Aesthetics
    - I've always been a huge fan of the aesthetics of paper currency, espescially the sort of webby, geometcic rosette patterns that's common on US bills. One of my favorite parts of the development of this project was researching all the different variations of money around the world

  Thematics
    - This rosette pattern was originally created by a geometric lathe, which works similar to a spirograph. This started in the 1800s, making the designs on paper currency an early form of generative art.
    - The reasons behind this design dovetail nicely with NFTs and crypto: the design was an early way to prove authenticity and show provenance.
    - Also, money is a super collectable item with a ton of variability

  Conceptual
    - Really what I'm trying to do is to bring into focus the financialization of art, particularly NFT-based art. And similar to some of the themes I explored with religion with CGK, really honing in on what gives these tokens value. Because I think it's a philosophical quesiton that everyone grapples with to some extent when they first get into NFTs -- and it's an important thing to grapple with -- but i feel like in the current market environment

    - So really I'm exploring all this by presenting visual components (like the rosette) that commonly appear on money and lend it credability, and making it look a lot like money... But it's not money. It's sort of a deconstruction of money as the colors, layout and components shift around. And I encourage the viewer to ask: why is it not money? why am I willing to







Fake Internet Money explores the relationship between art and financial assets. The optimistic interpretation of the project contrasts the mechanics of paper currency with cryptocurrency by painting fiat as absurd and anachronistic. This is explored through the use of guilloche patterns, which were originally used as mechanisms to prove the authenticity of the bill. With NFTs the authenticity and and provenance of the token are easy to verify. this optimistic outlook paints money as art, and focuses on how technology advances both money and art. the pessamistic interpretation casts art as money, and highlights the financialization of art. it suggests that the art's value is really a financial one, rather than an artistic one. in the optimistic case, the misprints highlight ths absurdity of encountering this type of error in the digital space. In the pessamistic case it acts as a deconstruction of the value of the piece, and comments on how fickle that value really is.



Basically, it's impossible to divorce the money from the art.





Fake Internet Money has value as money because it's backed by Proof of Art. It has value as art because it literally is money. It has value because of its high-tech anti conterfeiting devices, letting you know that it's authentic.




Fake Internet Money is the world's first on-chain fungible NFT currency. The monetary value of each bill is backed by a stunning generative work of art. Meanwhile, the artistic value of the piece is enhanced by its status as a financial asset. This symbiotic relationship guarantees



Think of how many $1 USD bills there are floating around out there. Each one is worth exactly $1. Printing more just creates more dollars minting as an act of wealth creation











Fake Internet Money invites the viewer/holder to critically examine the relationship between money and art. Viewing money _as_ art, and art _as_ money. In the context of NFTs, money and art become interchangable. What gives this piece value? How is this related to how art and fiat currencies are given value? Also examines the nature of authenticity

# PROCESS
  - maybe i should look into getting a studio.
  - i can't believe that people are paying me to make art. that's so fucking dope. they're paying me to make art that's also an investment vehicle of sorts.
  - i should really make a cheap, high mint project. unfortunately the turn that FIM si mtaking is towards the more expensive-looking. either way, ISID was a good type fo thsoe projects. high variability ones should be pretty hot right now.

  - i need to build a fucking react web form that takes peoples print orders. can make it really ronamerchy.
    - WOW! steviep's coooooooool NFTs

- should really start agenerative nft artists discord
  - factory/guild stuff


- it would be crazy if the core banking system goes down. I bet USDC would become the USD stand in

- think for any currency to sort of resemble the USD in terms of stability, it fundamentally needs to be inflationary. it needs to match the real economy.

- alie is totally wrong that making a deck. that's not how content is distributed in the cyypto industry. if it's more talky, demoy then i can make youtube videos out of it and posdcasts. it becomes more casually consumable. i guess that's the vibe i want my PR to go in. you casually enjoy the vibe. you're paying for my unemployment in general. you're paying me for the content. i really need to get a monitor to do live sessions


- some good sort of performance art would be to have the NFT be the artifact. what sorts of events would go into the creation of the NFT. NFT as an artifact.

- i really want to fucking nail the collectables genre of gen nfts. gen FTs

- i think there's a lot of potential in the FIM style of picking like



- i think half of The Money should be two tone. maybe even boring two tone

- one quarter should be builion
  - i can eak out a looooot of diversity by getting the buillion

- i should use ron as the guinnie pig for the cheaper paper. i should ask skink what they'd reccomend for cheaper paper

- reeeeeallly need to book marfa

- also need to look into


- misprint is too much space on either side
- misprint: lathe settings too high
-


Here's a fucking idea:
  - take the thirds layout and make that more crypto themed.
  - split the golden ratio into a square and the rest
  - FIM-esque color model.
  - on drop: set a time limit (like a week), open edition, and have the
  - three main styles. every once in a while a component or two jump across styles

  * so
    , remove objects/WMs from fiat-standard,
    , remove fiat-looking rosetes from


  * three different currency flavors: fiat, crypto, bullion. each bill is a basket of flavor currencies

i saw it ina dream website: you can move around a larger canvas

sell messengers and buy octogarden






# TODO

## MUST DO

- misprint rarities




- serial rarities
- i don't really like what i did with the double WM colors. should just be normal stroke, transparent. although, it looks good for ribbed rosettes




## SHOULD DO
- for buillion, objects shoudl be scratched out with bright color

## MAYBE DO
- holographic
- need to look at the dot texture. is there a way to make this look a little more organic?
- if solid border or no border, corner can just be number

- have a bits/bytes style. maybe crypto shoud be a lot more pixelated. that would actually be pretty cool.
  - how hard would it be to modify the *rosette engine* to draw squares instead of vertex?

- incorporate denomination rosette
- add only-dark rosette
- can i get rid of drawCircle in favor of drawShape?










## unstructured todos
- would be cool to credit the font. that's a real slyyyy fucking move to draw attention to it.
- need to spend more time felshing out the description.
- also, a lot more bills where the style is mixed and matched.
- if bills are wider, reassess ancillary components, serial, signature
- CGK with animation for crypto scheme?
- bullion
  - make rosette colors red or something to simulate jewels encrusted in the bill
- three fake internet currencies:
  fiat<>paper
  bulion<>metalic
  crypto<>digital
  peg the value to one another
    bullion: 21
    crypto: 34
    fiat: 55
- make sure dneomination is always displayed, exspecially in portrait
- make sure all numerals are shadowed on thirds layout
- certain border types have special corer possabilities
  - ex. missing border + curved corner borders can have plain numbers
  - bars can have light number text
- vintage double WM is pretty fucked















- middle rosette
  - rectangular background
  - little rosettes everywhere
  - little rosettes making up one larger rosette
  - smaller alternating rosette/bg/rosette/bg https://en.numista.com/catalogue/note231376.html



- colors
  - red/green/yellow https://en.numista.com/catalogue/note218041.html
  - https://en.numista.com/catalogue/note212473.html
  - black/white/red/green https://en.numista.com/catalogue/note218332.html




























LAYOUT TODOS
- random watermark function that
  - includes cgk
  - includes $
  - is properly sized
  - is properly colored
  - includes single large rosette corner WM
  - only shows up in a corner without a corner component
