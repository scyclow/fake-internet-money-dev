Fake Internet Money explores the relationship between art and financial assets. The optimistic interpretation of the project contrasts the mechanics of paper currency with cryptocurrency by painting fiat as absurd and anachronistic. This is explored through the use of guilloche patterns, which were originally used as mechanisms to prove the authenticity of the bill. With NFTs the authenticity and and provenance of the token are easy to verify. this optimistic outlook paints money as art, and focuses on how technology advances both money and art. the pessamistic interpretation casts art as money, and highlights the financialization of art. it suggests that the art's value is really a financial one, rather than an artistic one. in the optimistic case, the misprints highlight ths absurdity of encountering this type of error in the digital space. In the pessamistic case it acts as a deconstruction of the value of the piece, and comments on how fickle that value really is.




Fake Internet Money has value as money because it's backed by Proof of Art. It has value as art because it literally is money. It has value because of its high-tech anti conterfeiting devices, letting you know that it's authentic.




Fake Internet Money is the world's first on-chain fungible NFT currency. The monetary value of each bill is backed by a stunning generative work of art. Meanwhile, the artistic value of the piece is enhanced by its status as a financial asset. This symbiotic relationship guarantees



Think of how many $1 USD bills there are floating around out there. Each one is worth exactly $1. Printing more just creates more dollars minting as an act of wealth creation











Fake Internet Money invites the viewer/holder to critically examine the relationship between money and art. Viewing money _as_ art, and art _as_ money. In the context of NFTs, money and art become interchangable. What gives this piece value? How is this related to how art and fiat currencies are given value? Also examines the nature of authenticity

# TODO
- make sure all numerals are shadowed on thirds layout
- make max rosette stroke weight ~1.25
- make echo version of the numismatic border/background
- write generic function for displaying a rosette w/ background
  - choose the right rosette style
  - hole or no hole
  - single/double
  - only dark bg
- generic centerpiece fn
  - large rosette
  - portrait
    - empty
    - denomination
    - shape
    - smily face
    - CGK
  - florrette
  - double florette

- sides of centerpiece
  - double denomination ex [20 ( ) 20]
  - double centerpiece ex [( ) 20 ( )]
  - wax emblem
  - logic to have watermark, emblem on oposite sides

- audit backgrounds
  - add floral/bowtie type pattern background?







- line up corner instances with location of watermark
- make corners smaller
- certain border types have special corer possabilities
  - ex. missing border + curved corner borders can have plain numbers
  - bars can have light number text
- swap in different rosette types
- fix rosette bg -- for use dollarRosette for dollar rosette with higher stroke weight AND FILL
- only use floral borders with floral rosettes/numismatic
- move signature around depending on BL corner
- fix number lines
- parameterize rosettes better (type, bg color, hole, number/numeral/empty/$)
- reassess bg; maybe swap one out for something chain-y. maybe something that looks like a financial chart
- add some sort of numisotic stripe









- middle rosette
  - rectangular background
  - little rosettes everywhere
  - little rosettes making up one larger rosette
