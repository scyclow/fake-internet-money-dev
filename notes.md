Three intentions:
  Aesthetics
    - I've always been a huge fan of the aesthetics of paper currency, espescially the sort of webby, geometcic rosette patterns that's common on US bills. One of my favorite parts of the development of this project was researching all the different variations of money around the world

  Thematics
    - This rosette pattern was originally created by a geometric lathe, which works similar to a spirograph. This started in the 1800s, making the designs on paper currency an early form of generative art.
    - The reasons behind this design dovetail nicely with NFTs and crypto: the design was an early way to prove authenticity and show provenance.
    - Also, money is a super collectable item with a ton of variability
    - Also, it seems like the generative art NFT genre tends to lean towards either collectables or abstraction, and i thought this was a cool chance to put both of them together}}

  Conceptual
    - Really what I'm trying to do is to bring into focus the financialization of art, particularly NFT-based art. And similar to some of the themes I explored with religion with CGK, really honing in on what gives these tokens value. Because I think it's a philosophical quesiton that everyone grapples with to some extent when they first get into NFTs -- and it's an important thing to grapple with -- but i feel like in the current market environment

    - So really I'm exploring all this by presenting visual components (like the rosette) that commonly appear on money and lend it credability, and making it look a lot like money... But it's not money. It's sort of a deconstruction of money as the colors, layout and components shift around. And I encourage the viewer to ask: why is it not money? why am I willing to







Fake Internet Money explores the relationship between art and financial assets. The optimistic interpretation of the project contrasts the mechanics of paper currency with cryptocurrency by painting fiat as absurd and anachronistic. This is explored through the use of guilloche patterns, which were originally used as mechanisms to prove the authenticity of the bill. With NFTs the authenticity and and provenance of the token are easy to verify. this optimistic outlook paints money as art, and focuses on how technology advances both money and art. the pessamistic interpretation casts art as money, and highlights the financialization of art. it suggests that the art's value is really a financial one, rather than an artistic one. in the optimistic case, the misprints highlight ths absurdity of encountering this type of error in the digital space. In the pessamistic case it acts as a deconstruction of the value of the piece, and comments on how fickle that value really is.



Basically, it's impossible to divorce the money from the art.





Fake Internet Money has value as money because it's backed by Proof of Art. It has value as art because it literally is money. It has value because of its high-tech anti conterfeiting devices, letting you know that it's authentic.




Fake Internet Money is the world's first on-chain fungible NFT currency. The monetary value of each bill is backed by a stunning generative work of art. Meanwhile, the artistic value of the piece is enhanced by its status as a financial asset. This symbiotic relationship guarantees



Think of how many $1 USD bills there are floating around out there. Each one is worth exactly $1. Printing more just creates more dollars minting as an act of wealth creation











Fake Internet Money invites the viewer/holder to critically examine the relationship between money and art. Viewing money _as_ art, and art _as_ money. In the context of NFTs, money and art become interchangable. What gives this piece value? How is this related to how art and fiat currencies are given value? Also examines the nature of authenticity

# PROCESS
  - maybe i should look into getting a studio.
  - i can't believe that people are paying me to make art. that's so fucking dope. they're paying me to make art that's also an investment vehicle of sorts.
  - i should really make a cheap, high mint project. unfortunately the turn that FIM si mtaking is towards the more expensive-looking. either way, ISID was a good type fo thsoe projects. high variability ones should be pretty hot right now.

  - i need to build a fucking react web form that takes peoples print orders. can make it really ronamerchy.
    - WOW! steviep's coooooooool NFTs

- should really start agenerative nft artists discord
  - factory/guild stuff


- it would be crazy if the core banking system goes down. I bet USDC would become the USD stand in

- think for any currency to sort of resemble the USD in terms of stability, it fundamentally needs to be inflationary. it needs to match the real economy.

- alie is totally wrong that making a deck. that's not how content is distributed in the cyypto industry. if it's more talky, demoy then i can make youtube videos out of it and posdcasts. it becomes more casually consumable. i guess that's the vibe i want my PR to go in. you casually enjoy the vibe. you're paying for my unemployment in general. you're paying me for the content. i really need to get a monitor to do live sessions


- some good sort of performance art would be to have the NFT be the artifact. what sorts of events would go into the creation of the NFT. NFT as an artifact.

- i really want to fucking nail the collectables genre of gen nfts. gen FTs

- i think there's a lot of potential in the FIM style of picking like



- i think half of The Money should be two tone. maybe even boring two tone

- one quarter should be builion
  - i can eak out a looooot of diversity by getting the buillion

- i should use ron as the guinnie pig for the cheaper paper. i should ask skink what they'd reccomend for cheaper paper

- reeeeeallly need to book marfa

- also need to look into


- misprint is too much space on either side
- misprint: lathe settings too high
-


Here's a fucking idea:
  - take the thirds layout and make that more crypto themed.
  - split the golden ratio into a square and the rest
  - FIM-esque color model.
  - on drop: set a time limit (like a week), open edition, and have the
  - three main styles. every once in a while a component or two jump across styles

  * so
    , remove objects/WMs from fiat-standard,
    , remove fiat-looking rosetes from


  * three different currency flavors: fiat, crypto, bullion. each bill is a basket of flavor currencies

## SHOULD DO
- for buillion, objects shoudl be scratched out with bright color

## MAYBE DO
- holographic
- need to look at the dot texture. is there a way to make this look a little more organic?
- if solid border or no border, corner can just be number

- have a bits/bytes style. maybe crypto shoud be a lot more pixelated. that would actually be pretty cool.
  - how hard would it be to modify the *rosette engine* to draw squares instead of vertex?

- incorporate denomination rosette
- add only-dark rosette
- can i get rid of drawCircle in favor of drawShape?










## unstructured todos
- would be cool to credit the font. that's a real slyyyy fucking move to draw attention to it.
- need to spend more time felshing out the description.
- also, a lot more bills where the style is mixed and matched.
- if bills are wider, reassess ancillary components, serial, signature
- CGK with animation for crypto scheme?
- bullion
  - make rosette colors red or something to simulate jewels encrusted in the bill
- three fake internet currencies:
  fiat<>paper
  bulion<>metalic
  crypto<>digital
  peg the value to one another
    bullion: 21
    crypto: 34
    fiat: 55
- make sure dneomination is always displayed, exspecially in portrait
- make sure all numerals are shadowed on thirds layout
- certain border types have special corer possabilities
  - ex. missing border + curved corner borders can have plain numbers
  - bars can have light number text
- vintage double WM is pretty fucked

Fake interview




CG: Thank you so much joining me today Steve!

SP: Of course. A pleasure as always.





CG: First off, I just want to say how amazing of a project this is. Thd attention to detail and varierty of each test mint I've seen is truly breathtaking.


CG: I think there's a lot to dig into here, but why don't we start with the title? I have to admit, it's very funny and does an excellent job of framing the tone of the whole project. Can you talk a bit about why you chose it?

SP: Sure, I think in some ways my creative process is a little backwards, where I think of a title first, and then build the project around










+++++++++++++++++++++++



CG: Steve! Thanks so much for joining me again

SP: Of course. The pleasure's all mine!

CG: Last time we spoke it was about your previous artblocks project, CryptoGodKing. It's since turned into a cult-classic of sorts. Your sophmore generative art effort, I Saw It in a Dream, was also highly successful, and is really a beautiful project.

SP: Thank you so much, that means a lot!

CG: So with two generative art projects under your belt you've decided to tackle generative paper currency, which is an interesting choice! Paper currency design isn't typically what I think of when I think generative art. What led you to that decision?

  First and foremost, I'm a huge fan of paper currency design. Whenever I go to a new country I'm always really excited to take home a piece of their money as a souvenir. I just love staring at the intricate geometric designs on them and appreciating their diversity. So given how much I like the aesthetics and how much I enjoy collecting it, I thought it fit very well into the generative NFT space and I had a strong desire to explore it.


CG: It really is a cool aesthetic, and I think you nailed it. The balance between the abstract and the concrete is also very interesting here. On one hand, it strikes me as a collectable project because each iteration looks like a real thing with different characteristics. But on the other hand, a lot of the components are very abstract and unique. It's almost like they are generative art pieces within a generative art piece.

  Yeah, that's definitely one of the reasons I chose this project. As far as I can tell, paper currency was actually an early canvas for generative art. The sort of webby, geometric pattern that appears around the edges of US currency, which is called a Guilloché pattent, started appearing on US currency in the 1800s as an anti-counterfeiting measure. It was generated by this machine called a geometric lathe, which worked a lot like a spirograph. So if you swapped out one gear for another you ended up with a totally different pattern. Ultimately having these intricate patterns proved that whoever printed it had enough resources to own this big, expensive machine -- and as a result, that the bill was authentic.

CG: Generative art to prove authenticity, I like it! On the note of authenticity, the title of the collection is called Fake Internet Money. It definitely stands out and sets an interesting tone. Can you talk a bit about why you chose that title?

  SP: There are a couple reasons I chose it. One reason is that it draws attention to the fact that it's _not trying_ to be real money. It really emphasizes the fakeness of it, and in doing so it sort of helps deconstruct the idea of what money really is.

  And the other reason is that, as you know, the term "Fake Internet Money" is often used to jokingly describe cryptocurrency. The value of it is very abstract, and to a lot of people it's just an arbitrary number decided by the internet. And really at the end of the day I think this project is about how value is subjective. Whether we're talking about art or money, there's really no cosmic source of truth that determines what "true value" is. So I felt it was important to make that connection.


CG: Those are both really interesting points, and I want to drill into both of them. Can you start by elaborating on the fakeness and deconstruction angle?

  Sure. On one hand, I've designed the project to _sort of almost_ look like real money to the point where it's sitting in that uncanny valley space. You look at it, you see the denomination, you see the familiar patterns, the texture, the layout, etc. And if you're not paying close attention you might possibly mistake some of them for real money. But if you look at it for more than a couple seconds, it feels off. You might realize that the sizing and aspect ratios are off, or that things you're used to seeing on paper currency are missing.

  And then I take this a step further by adding or removing elements to make it resemble real-life currency less and less. Sometimes I change the layout to resemble a lottery ticket more than a standard piece of currency. Sometimes I use a highly saturated color palette to give it a futuristic-crypto look. Sometimes a "misprint" will throw the whole system into chaos. But despite these curve balls there are enough similarities throughout the collection that they all at least resemble money.

  So ultimately you're left with something that's pretty clearly not real money, but the act of questioning why forces you to think about what constitutes money.

CG: Right, and getting back to your point on value, I suppose one has to ask why this project has any value if it proports to be money but is also worthless as money.


  Exactly. And I'm really excited to see how the different iterations end up being valued on the secondary market. As funny as it would be to see all the 100 bills going for exactly 100x the price as the 1 bills, something tells me that prices won't line up exactly with what the listed denomination is. These are Non-Fungible Tokens we're dealing with, after all.

CG: What sorts of things do you see playing into that valuation?

  Well, I don't want to spoil too much here, but I think it's really interesting to look at cases where in "real" currency markets $1 is worth more or less than $1. Earlier we talked about aesthetics essentially defining whether $1 was worth $1 or $0 in the 1800s. But those same bills, (many of which are absolutely gorgeous) are now worth much much more as collector items entirely because of the aesthetics. Similarly, you have arbitrary rarities like cool serial numbers demanding a premium in the secondary market. And misprints are even more interesting! Even though their exchange value is officially 0, there are thriving markets paying premiums for "worthless" money.


CG: Yeah, and I guess even on a base level, stripping away all the idiosyncracies, the idea that everyone kind of "agrees" on the value of money is a pretty wild idea.

  Right, like typically fiat currencies claim to have an "objective" value, which is determined by a treasury, enforced by men with guns, etc. And that's all fine, but really this just acts as a central point of coordination to the larger monetary system in which value is  determined by people accepting the money for goods and services.

CG: How many boxes of serial can I buy with my arbitrary government numbers?

  So even though this is the sort of philosophical crisis everyone gets into when they first start interacting with NFTs and cryptocurrency, I think it's really interesting when you start putting together everything we've talked about so far. On one hand, the authenticity of the token is baked in by the block chain, so it removes the need for a central authority to put their stamp of approval on it. But on the other hand, the value of the token is sort of floating around in la la land. There's no single authoritative source saying what any of it should be worth, so it all ends up being socially determined.

  And what ends up being the primary driver of value with NFTs? Aesthetics and rare traits. Basically the same things that hard currency collectors at!


CG: Fascinating stuff! Given your history with projects like FastCashMoneyPlus I was

  SP: Don't get me wrong, I'm definitely leaning into it. And I think there's a definite subtext of the FastCash tone in there, but it's just not taking center stage on this particular project. Or, I don't know... maybe it does center stage! I think there are multiple ways to interpret this particular piece, and I don't want to dictate one specific interpretation.

  In any case, I started coming up with the concept months ago, so there's no way I could have predicted the direction everthing would go in. But I think the insanity of the current NFT market is really just an extension of a lot of the themes that we've talked about, so I'm going to chalk it up as a win.


CG: Aside from FastCash, how does this project relate to some of your previous work?

  SP: Most recently I explored a lot of these themes through the lense of religion with CryptoGodKing. And I think CGK fans will be pleasently surprised with how these two projects relate to each other. Also, fans of I Saw It in a Dream will probably notice that the core pattern of that project kind of resembles the pattern used inside the standard rosette of this project. That's definitely not a coincidence! It took a lot of experimentation to get it right, so the I Saw It in a Dream pattern is sort of an out take of that.

CG: That's so cool! It's great you were able to squeeze another project out of all the work you did on this one.

  SP: It was a happy accident!

CG: Well Steve, it's been great chatting with you, and I'm excited to see how the drop turns out!

SP: Likewise!



















+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++




  So my intention with all of this is that I want each piece to be in a sort of dialogue with the rest of the collection.





Personally, I think it's very funny, and provides some really on-point commentary about what's happening happening in the NFT market these days.













CG: Would you mind elaborating about these themes? Given your history with projects like FastCashMoneyPlus and our last conversation about CryptoGodKing I suspect that there's quite a bit more underneath the surface.















  we have to acknowledge the current market environment where people don't even care about any of these things themselves -- they're just trying to make a few bucks by buying low and selling high. So a lot of time the value of the art ends up being determined entirely by its ETH market value, which is then determined entirely by its USD market value. And once you let the market determine the value of things you end up with a Keynesian Beauty Contest where what you think is irrelevent. All that matters is what you think other people think... which means what you think other people think other people think, and so on.


CG: And how does the title play into it?



CG: Fascinating stuff! What are some of the methods you use to explore the idea of deconstruction?







  SP: Sure. I think the most obvious tool i use here is the big fat denomination plastered on the bills. I think the idea of one piece of fake internet money being worth 100x more than another one simply because of an arbitrary number printed on it is kind of funny. So I'm curious to see if the 100 bills will be worth 100x more than the 1 bills.

  And then the next most obvious thing is the color scheme. Bills can fall into three general buckets: fiat, crypto, and bullion. It should be obvious which is which. But



  the rosette component. These sorts of complex geometric patterns were originally developed as a way of proving the authenticity of money in an era where tons of counterfeit bills were floating. So FIM "proves" the authenticity of each bill by employing a similar rosette-style pattern. And what you end up with is a set of inttricate, ornate-looking bills with these complex patterns that actually resemble real money. but they're pretty clearly not real money because certain things appear on real momney are missing. (i'll leave what exactly is missing as an exercise to the viewer). so if you're not paying close attention you end up in this uncanny valley type of space where you sort of think you're looking at money, but something feels off about it. And this emphasizes the question: why _isn't_ this real money?

  Taking it a step further


  the goal here when composing the attributes of the collection was to have each piece be in a sort of dialogue with each other


CG: So earlier you mentioned provenance as something that hard currency collectors look for. And I think when you're launching a project like this you can't really simulate that very easily,



CG: is this a comment on the insanity of the current market?
I didn't see the current NFT market insanity when I first conceived of the project, i think the insanity is a natural outcome of these themes that I sought to explore.









CG; interesting -- how does this relate to fastcash?
